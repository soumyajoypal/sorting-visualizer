                <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
                <p>
                    Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
                    and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until
                    the list is sorted. It's named so because smaller elements "bubble" to the
                    top of the list with each iteration.

            <div class="info-box">
                <h2>Selection Sort</h2>
                <p>
                    Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: the sorted sublist and
                    the unsorted sublist. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the
                    unsorted sublist and moves it to the beginning of the sorted sublist. This
                    process continues until the unsorted sublist is empty.

            <div class="info-box">
                <h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
                <p>
                    Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It
                    iterates through the input list, removing one element at a time and
                    inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the array. This
                    process continues until the entire list is sorted.

            <div class="info-box">
                <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
                <p>
                    Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input array
                    into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted
                    halves to produce the final sorted array. The merging step involves comparing
                    elements from the two halves and arranging them in the correct order.

            <div class="info-box">
                <h2>Quick Sort</h2>
                <p>
                    Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a "pivot"
                    element from the array and partitions the other elements into two subarrays
                    according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then
                    recursively sorts the subarrays. The key operation is the partitioning step,
                    which rearranges the elements so that the pivot is in its correct position
                    in the final sorted array.

                <h2>Heap Sort</h2>
                <p>
                    Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes the heap data structure.
                    It first builds a heap from the elements of the array, ensuring that the heap property
                    is satisfied. Then, it repeatedly removes the maximum (for max-heap) or minimum (for min-heap)
                    element from the heap and rebuilds the heap. This process continues until all elements
                    have been removed from the heap, resulting in a sorted array.
